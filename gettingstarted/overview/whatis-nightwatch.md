### What is Nightwatch?

Nightwatch.js is an automated testing framework for web applications and websites, written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and using the [W3C WebDriver API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) (formerly [Selenium WebDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol)).

It is a complete browser (_End-to-End_) testing solution which aims to simplify the process of setting up **Continuous Integration** and writing automated tests. Nightwatch can also be used for writing Node.js unit tests.

> Nightwatch got its name from the famous painting [The Night Watch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch) by Dutch artist [Rembrandt van Rijn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn). The masterpiece is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam - The Netherlands.
