### Overview of WebDriver

WebDriver is a general purpose library for automating web browsers. It was started as part of the [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) project, which is a very popular and comprehensive set of tools for browser automation, initially written for Java but now with support for most programming languages.

Nightwatch uses the [WebDriver API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver) to perform the browser automation related tasks, like opening windows and clicking links for instance.

[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver) is now a W3C specification, which aims to standardize browser automation. WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform and a restful HTTP api as a way for web browsers to be remotely controlled.
