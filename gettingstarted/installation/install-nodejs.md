### Install Node.js

From [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/):

> "Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices."

There are installation packages and instructions for most major Operating systems on its website [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/). Remember to install also the **npm** tool, which is the node package manager and is distributed with the Node.js installer.
